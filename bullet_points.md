I joined *Wazoku Ltd* as a software engineer and steadily advanced to the role of Technical Team Lead. Throughout my time here, I’ve been integral to the company's growth, honing my skills and leading a team of three developers. My journey has been defined by both technical contributions and leadership responsibilities.

In my role as Team Lead, I played a key part in fostering a delivery-focused culture across engineering, product, QA, and design teams. A crucial aspect of my work involved prioritizing tasks and collaborating closely with product teams to ensure clarity on objectives, avoiding wasted engineering effort, and aligning technical execution with business goals.

### **Key Responsibilities:**

- **Technical Leadership:** Directed the design and implementation of new product features, ensuring adherence to technical best practices.
- **Team Management:** Supervised a team of developers, providing mentorship and ensuring high productivity through regular code reviews and discussions on best practices.
- **Agile Collaboration:** Led sprint planning in a fast-paced, 2-week sprint Agile environment, coordinating between product owners and stakeholders to turn business requirements into technical solutions.
- **System Optimization:** Regularly reviewed and optimized existing systems, focusing on reducing API response times and enhancing database query efficiency.

- **Third-Party Integrations:** Integrated third-party tools, such as Analytics and translation services, into the platform for improved user experience.
- **Architecture Design:** Participated in designing and evolving our microservices-based architecture to support a multi-tenant SaaS platform.

Our primary project, a complex multi-tenant enterprise SaaS application, was centered around a RESTful API and built with Angular to deliver a seamless single-page application experience. I also focused on the continuous improvement of development processes, introducing new tools and methodologies to optimize team performance.

I remain committed to optimizing system performance and driving team success through mentorship and a shared focus on delivering high-quality, scalable software.
