Hiring Manager  
Reincubate  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineer (Python/JS, remote GMT) position at Reincubate. With over 10 years of experience as a Full Stack Python Developer, I have developed strong expertise in Python, Django, JavaScript, and cloud-based infrastructures, which aligns closely with the requirements of this role.

At Wazoku Ltd, I led a team responsible for developing and maintaining large-scale SaaS applications, focusing on robust backend systems and seamless integrations. My experience with Python, JavaScript, and API design, along with my passion for building user-friendly products, makes me confident in my ability to contribute to Reincubateâ€™s innovative solutions, such as Camo.

I am particularly excited about Reincubate's values-driven approach and its focus on creating highly-polished products that deliver exceptional user experiences. I thrive in collaborative environments and look forward to the opportunity to help further modernise your tooling and architecture while contributing to the continuous growth of your products.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills can benefit your team.

Sincerely,  
**Evald Spedzhev**
