## **Professional Experience**

### **Software Engineering Technical Team Lead**  
**Wazoku Ltd** - *Bristol, UK*  
*10/2017 – 10/2024* - 9 years

I joined *Wazoku Ltd* as a software engineer and became a valuable asset to the business, continuously improving my skills.
As a result, I was entrusted with the responsibilities of a technical team lead within one of our teams.
In this role, I played a key part in collaborating with QA, product, and design teams to foster a delivery-focused ethos within the engineering department and my team.

Key challenges included efficient task prioritisation and working closely with product teams to understand checkpoints and avoid unnecessary engineering efforts.
I led the technical direction for designing and implementing new product features, ensuring alignment with business goals and technical best practices.

My responsibilities also included supervising a team of three developers, providing mentorship, and maintaining productivity at the desired levels.
I continuously participated in improving development processes, including the adoption of new tools and methodologies.

As a team, we focused on ensuring high code quality through code reviews, discussing best practices, and implementing them within the existing codebase.
We took on the challenge of working with product owners and stakeholders to translate business requirements into technical solutions within a fast-paced, 2-week sprint Agile development cycle.

We regularly reviewed our existing systems to find ways to optimise performance, including reducing API response times and improving database query efficiency.
The main project was a complex multi-tenant enterprise SaaS application, with core functionality built around utilising RESTful APIs with the Angular framework to deliver a single-page application experience to end users.

Test coverage was achieved with a high number of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
I also participated in implementing third-party integrations, including analytics and translations.

## **Key Achievements**

- Partnered with the data science team to implement and launch an embedded analytics platform using Sisense, enhancing data-driven decision-making capabilities for clients.
- Completed a major refactor of core application entities (Entity Builder), significantly improving customer engagement and laying the groundwork for future enhancements.
- Implemented a foundational module (Organisations feature) that evolved into a revenue-generating product, contributing to the company’s financial growth.
- Played a crucial role in implementing internationalisation (i18n) across the codebase, expanding the product’s appeal to a broader international customer base.
- Developed a proof of concept for migrating from agency-based translation services to automated translations using DeepL, which was later implemented by the team and resulted in substantial cost savings on translation expenses.
